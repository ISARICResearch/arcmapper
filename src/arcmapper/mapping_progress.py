"""Mapping progress for ARC to FHIR.

ARC is the data dictionary containing the set of questions with possible
responses being developed by ISARIC at
https://github.com/ISARICResearch/DataPlatform/tree/main/ARCH

Each of the ARC variables is mapped to a FHIR resource with the corresponding
resource elements. FHIR resource descriptions can be obtained at
https://hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html, and the mapping file specification is
at https://fhirflat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/mapping.html
